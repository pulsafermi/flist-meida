# F-List Media
Let's be real, the current method of just using the [url] tag works, nothing wrong with that, but often, that forces someone to another tab, and takes them away from your profile.

What if there was a way to fully embedd your content into your f-list profile? But in a way that's as easy as using BBCode?

## Tampermonkey
I'm not going to explain what tampermonkey is or how it works beyond this;

**Tampermonkey** is an extension for your browser that will run custom scripts, and can change a ton of things in your web browser. This is an extremely powerful tool, and can absolutely be used for nefarious purposes.

Please read through the code, and verify it is doing what it's supposed to be.

You can [Get it Here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=chrome).
